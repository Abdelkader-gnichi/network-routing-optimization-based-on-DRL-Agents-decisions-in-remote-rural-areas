## Introduction

Connectivity remains a persistent challenge in remote and rural areas, limiting the potential for community development and access to global networks. This project introduces a cutting-edge solution leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), in combination with Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The primary goal is to optimize packet routing within backhaul networks, thus overcoming connectivity obstacles. Additionally, the project aims to eliminate the human factor that not only consumes financial resources but also elevates the risk of errors during network management.

## Features

- Dueling DDQN Agent: The project deploys a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) agent, harnessing the capabilities of Deep Reinforcement Learning. This intelligent agent makes decisions to optimize packet routing within SDN-based backhaul networks.

- Community Connectivity Assurance: Ensuring reliable connectivity for communities in remote regions, bridging the gap between isolated areas and the global network.

- Backhaul SDN-Based Network Optimization: Intelligent packet routing optimizations within the backhaul network, enhancing the efficiency and performance of data transfer.

- Quality of Service (QoS) Compliance: A crucial aspect of the project is to respect Quality of Service limits during packet routing, prioritizing factors such as minimal delay. This ensures a seamless and reliable network experience for users in remote/rural areas.

This project represents a forward-looking approach to addressing connectivity issues, utilizing AI technologies to bring about positive impacts on community development and network performance in challenging geographic locations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **ns-3:** This is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems. We will use ns-3 to simulate the backhaul network, representing the environment in which our Dueling DDQN agent interacts to make decisions ensuring packet routing to their destinations. ns-3 is free and open-source software. You can obtain it from the official website [here](https://www.nsnam.org/) or directly from its GitHub [repository](https://github.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev-git).








# for this script simulation i use ns-3.37 and the ofswitch13 library.


### To download ofswitch13 use this link https://github.com/ljerezchaves/ofswitch13/releases/tag/5.2.0
### also i install netanim for graphic simulation but it is optionnal since i only want you (Tom) to help me out to fix the error

### this is how to install ofswitch13 with ns-3.37:

2.1.1 Before starting 

Before starting, ensure you have the following minimal requirements installed on your system:
```
$ sudo apt install g++ python3 cmake ninja-build git
$ sudo apt install make pkg-config libtool libboost-dev
2.1.2 Compiling the code

Clone the ns-3 source code repository into your machine and checkout a stable version (we are using the ns-3.37):
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev.git
$ cd ns-3-dev
$ git checkout -b ns-3.37 ns-3.37
Download the OFSwitch13 code into the contrib/ folder.
$ cd contrib/
$ git clone https://github.com/ljerezchaves/ofswitch13.git 

Update the OFSwitch13 code to a stable version (we are using release 5.2.0, which is compatible with ns-3.37)2 :

$ cd ofswitch13
$ git checkout 5.2.0
Go back to the ns-3 root directory and patch the ns-3 code with the appropriated ofswitch13 patch available under the
ofswitch13/utils/ directory (check for the correct ns-3 version):
$ cd ../../
$ patch -p1 < contrib/ofswitch13/utils/ofswitch13-3_37.patch 

1 Other distributions or versions may require different steps, especially regarding library compilation.
2 Starting at OFSwitch13 release 5.2.0, the cmake build system will automatically download and compile the correct version of BOFUSS library
(Internet connection is required). For older OFSwitch13 releases, we suggest you check the documentation and follow the proper build steps.
7OFSwitch13 Module Documentation, Release 5.2.0
This patch creates the new OpenFlow receive callback at CsmaNetDevice and VirtualNetDevice, allowing OpenFlow
switch to get raw packets from these devices. The module also brings a csma-full-duplex patch for improving CSMA
connections with full-duplex support. This is an optional patch that can be applyed after the ofswitch13 patch.
Now, configure the ns-3. By default, the cmake build system will handle BOFUSS library download and compilation.
Anyway, if your want to use a custom BOFUSS library, use the -DNS3_OFSWITCH13_BOFUSS_PATH configuration option
to specify its location:

$ ./ns3 configure 

Check for the enabled ns-3 OFSwitch13 integration feature after configuration. Finally, compile the simulator:

$ ./ns3 build  
```
# Thatâ€™s it! Enjoy your ns-3 fresh compilation with OpenFlow 1.3 capabilities.

### after building up the ofswitch13 module you can clone the myofswitch13-first.cc file into scratch file in the ns3 directoriy and  simply run it with:
``` 
./ns3 run scratch/myofswitch13-first.cc

```

### this is the error i that i want to fix :
